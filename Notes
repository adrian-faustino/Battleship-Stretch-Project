As soon as game starts -> gen new board, split screen? 


//Start game
-generate board (setTimout animation)
-at this point there should be my board vs opp board? array like myCoord = {a1 : 0, a2 : 0...z9: 0}
opCoord = {a1: 0, a2: 0....z1: 0} 
0 -> no boat (since we are just generating board.. maybe use obj constructor?)


//SET MODE
-drag n drop onto board
-at this point there should be a myCoord with 1s... {c1: 1, d1: 1, e1: 1, f1: 1}
1 -> boat is present


//PLAY MODE
-hide own board? change opacity with --var
-> have 2 boards, on the other board, send the oppCoord {} with the 1s to the other side with hidden properties
-TURN counter variable, 0 and 1s?


Player vs AI MODE
-myCoord {} with OPACITY properties board on the left
-oppCoord {} with HIDDEN properties board on right


Game flow: FUNCTIONS NEEDED [USING: variables..]
1. click new game
generateBoard();
-loops through [USING: maxRows, maxColumns]
-return 2D Div array 
-set this function to a varialbe to access DIVS (use for adding event listeners)

2. player drag n drops ships

3. press start game
  3.1 1 vs AI mode?
    -hideBoard


#. not sure where to use yet/ helper FUNCTIONS
addListener(listenerStr, callback)
-takes string e.g. 'click' for onclick listener
-callback function e.g. () => console.log('hi')
-(set this to a variable so we can remove later?)

removeListener(varName)
-take the var name and remove it. (TEST THIS)


KNOWN PROBLEMS:
-ai keeps attacking same box [SOLVED]
-ai hitting even on non active tile [SOLVED]
-ai 'hit' but didn't change any tiles? [SOLVED]
-ai copies  my move (because we are basing hitIndex based on current ile) THHE ISSUE IS THE INDEX FOR RECOLORING IS WRONG [SOLVED]

-player can attack on own board during game mode [SOLVED]

-AI move over 100 causes infinite recursion loop since there are no more empty tiles [SOLVED]

-player can attack an already hit tile [SOLVED]


KNOWN WORKS:
-how my occupied array is made during set mode.



next tasks:
generate ai ships [CURRENT TASK];
drag and drop
way to detect if all ships are sunk (just use Object.values to see if there are any 1s every turn?..);


//GENERATE AI SHIPS tasks [FUNCTIONS]
--> We just need to make AIships {}. That's all.

-generateKeyValPair(rows), takes number of rows for your object (up to 26), returns {a...z[1]: 0...n};
--> assign this function to a var name so we can access is like the object 'occupied' to store AI boats
[THIS CREATES THE OBJECT] --> set this variable AIships

-randomBoat(num), takes a number for the length of ship. Returns 
--> use randomNumber to generate start point?

-logCoord(row, column), takes 2 numbers, a row and a column, and CONVERTS it to [a, 1].. use this on toKey() to convert it into a key like a1, a2....
toKey([THIS CREATES CURRENT row,column TO KEY])

As soon as game starts -> gen new board, split screen? 


//Start game
-generate board (setTimout animation)
-at this point there should be my board vs opp board? array like myCoord = {a1 : 0, a2 : 0...z9: 0}
opCoord = {a1: 0, a2: 0....z1: 0} 
0 -> no boat (since we are just generating board.. maybe use obj constructor?)


//SET MODE
-drag n drop onto board
-at this point there should be a myCoord with 1s... {c1: 1, d1: 1, e1: 1, f1: 1}
1 -> boat is present


//PLAY MODE
-hide own board? change opacity with --var
-> have 2 boards, on the other board, send the oppCoord {} with the 1s to the other side with hidden properties
-TURN counter variable, 0 and 1s?


Player vs AI MODE
-myCoord {} with OPACITY properties board on the left
-oppCoord {} with HIDDEN properties board on right


Game flow: FUNCTIONS NEEDED [USING: variables..]
1. click new game
generateBoard();
-loops through [USING: maxRows, maxColumns]
-return 2D Div array 
-set this function to a varialbe to access DIVS (use for adding event listeners)

2. player drag n drops ships

3. press start game
  3.1 1 vs AI mode?
    -hideBoard


#. not sure where to use yet/ helper FUNCTIONS
addListener(listenerStr, callback)
-takes string e.g. 'click' for onclick listener
-callback function e.g. () => console.log('hi')
-(set this to a variable so we can remove later?)

removeListener(varName)
-take the var name and remove it. (TEST THIS)


KNOWN PROBLEMS:
-ai keeps attacking same box
-ai hitting even on non active tile
